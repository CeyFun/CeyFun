<p align="center">I'm a French university student studying mathematics, software engineering and quantum optics, among other things like DJing, Japanese and Korean, politics, psychology, etc.</p>
<p align="center">I love to learn new things and to use that knowledge to learn even more stuff. For example, <i>Why is the sky blue?</i> With a little bit of physics, math and computer science, you can easily code a simulation of light diffraction in the atmosphere and obtain a beautiful blue color!</p>
